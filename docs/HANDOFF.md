# Handoff

## Completed

- Created the local project directory and Git ignore rules.
- Reviewed the paper, the original author implementation, the TensorFlow 2 reference implementation, and dm_control.
- Pinned the original Dreamer V1 upstream commit: `d517542f9777c53864ff6f2683cea88be9ea98ac`.
- Fixed `cartpole_swingup` as the first task and recorded the pixel, action-repeat, and step-count conventions.
- Added a dependency-free environment check and project metadata tests.
- Added a bounded random-policy pixel rollout entry point at
  `scripts/random_rollout.py` and a midterm report draft.

## Verified

- Host: Apple Silicon macOS, with Python 3.14.6 available through Conda.
- Project-document and no-fabricated-results tests passed (`/opt/anaconda3/bin/python3 -m pytest -q`).
- The environment inventory ran with `/opt/anaconda3/bin/python3`; the default `/usr/bin/python3` is Python 3.9.6.
- TensorFlow, TensorFlow Probability, dm_control, and dm_env are not installed; pixel environments and training entry points were therefore not run.
- A project-local `.venv` was created and `dm-control` plus its non-maze
  dependencies were installed. The macOS pixel probe did not pass: OSMesa is
  unavailable, and the default graphical initialization did not complete within
  the bounded check. This is a local renderer limitation, not a training result.

## Not verified

- Compatibility of TensorFlow 1.13.1 and TensorFlow Probability 0.6.0 with the current macOS/Python setup.
- The distinction between default `python3` and Conda Python has not yet been unified with a project environment file.
- dm_control/MuJoCo pixel rendering, a short random-policy video, and all training results.
- A local random-policy video/frame artifact; the script is ready, but the
  renderer must be verified on a supported backend.
- Kaggle authentication succeeded for `daniel999929`, but the new notebook
  session failed with `Firebase: Error (auth/internal-error)` after one retry
  and a page refresh. No Kaggle compute result is claimed.
- Linux GPU dependencies, CUDA, EGL, checkpoint recovery, and formal evaluation.
- The GitHub account, repository creation, push, and pull request are now completed; the pull request remains open.

## Blockers

- The local machine does not have the `gh` CLI; shell DNS access to GitHub is unavailable, so browser-based GitHub operations were used.
- University GPU access, SSH host details, and the scheduling system are not yet confirmed.

## Next steps

1. Confirm the university Linux GPU environment and storage/scheduler details.
2. Install and pin the upstream dependencies on Linux.
3. Run a short debug check, then a small `cartpole_swingup` preflight.
4. After the preflight passes, begin the formal reproduction protocol; keep PR #1 open until the project has a validated training result.
